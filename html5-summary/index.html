	In the article section "Has design become too hard?", Zeldman discusses how now a days
most designers are unsatisfied with what they do and that nothing is perfect for most designers, today
it takes a lot of focus to master the art of coding. Tools have developed, new ones have been discovered
and has become more complicated for web designers. One problem with web design was
 people owning different platforms. Many of the screens were different sizes so it became
 difficult to create something that was required to be universal and adjustable to all sizes
  of different monitors/platforms.</p>

<p>For an example, the web design would adjust to a <abbr title="Personal Computer">
 PC</abbr> but not for a Mac. To fix this problem <mark><b>liquid layout</b></mark> was to help work around
 the different types monitors and help it act as one. Web design today has been made more
 convenient but nothing is ever easy, there will always be room for improvement. <ins datetime="2016-09-14">This is my active voice fix.</ins>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<h3>Quotes from Zeldman:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
 		"Digital design is not what it used to be, we say. The fun has gone out of it."
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
 		<p>"We tried “liquid layout” to work around the fact that every monitor was different.
  		Our clients demanded we put everything above the fold, and we acted as if there was one—a
  		consensual hallucination, when there were as many folds as there were screens, browsers,
   		and user-adjustable settings."
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> "when we got a standardized layout language for the web, every browser supported
		 it differently for years."
		 </p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> <mark><b>Liquid Layout-</b></mark> resizing the length, width and height of the browser depending
		       on the device that you are using.
